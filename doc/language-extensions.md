## Recommended language extensions

There are a number of commonly used language extensions that work well with
Jump, and are generally recommended to be turned on unless there's a strong
reason to do otherwise. These are:

* `NoImplicitPrelude`
* `OverloadedStrings`
* `ScopedTypeVariables`
* `RankNTypes`
* `GADTs`
* `TypeFamilies`
