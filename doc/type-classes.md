# Type Classes

*If this is your first time reading a Jump tutorial, consider reading the [Jump
tutorial tips](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/jump/blob/master/TIPS.md).*

There are a number of type classes commonly used and recommended in Jump. This
document enumerates these typeclasses, together with a short motivation on why
they are useful and links for further information. It is not intended to be an
in-depth explanation of each typeclass.
